JAVA KEYWORDS
1. Access Control
•	public, private, protected – control how accessible a class, method, or variable is from other parts of a program.
2. Class, Object, and Interface
•	class – defines a blueprint for objects.
•	interface – defines abstract methods that classes can implement.
•	extends – used when a class inherits from another class.
•	implements – used when a class implements an interface.
•	new – creates a new object.
•	this – refers to the current object.
•	super – refers to the parent (superclass) of the current object.
3. Data Types
•	byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char – represent different kinds of data values (numbers, characters, true/false, etc.).
4. Flow Control
•	if, else – make decisions based on conditions.
•	switch, case, default – handle multiple possible conditions.
•	while, do, for – repeat code (loops).
•	break, continue – control how loops run.
•	return – send a value back from a method.
5. Exception Handling
•	try, catch, finally – handle runtime errors safely.
•	throw, throws – send or declare exceptions in methods.
6. Modifiers
•	static – makes a member belong to the class instead of an object.
•	final – prevents modification (e.g., constant variables, unchangeable methods).
•	abstract – defines a method or class that must be completed by subclasses.
•	synchronized – controls access to blocks of code by multiple threads.
•	volatile, transient – affect how variables are stored or serialized.
•	native – indicates a method is written in another language (like C).
•	strictfp – ensures consistent floating-point calculations across platforms.
7. Package/Import
•	package – groups related classes.
•	import – allows use of classes from other packages.
8. Other Keywords
•	void – specifies that a method doesn’t return a value.
•	enum – defines a fixed set of constants.
•	assert – tests assumptions during debugging.
•	instanceof – checks if an object belongs to a particular class.
•	const, goto – reserved but not used in Java.
9. Newer Additions (Java 10+)
•	var – declares a variable with inferred type.
•	record – defines a compact class for immutable data.
•	sealed, permits, non-sealed – control which classes can extend or implement another class.
•	yield – returns a value from a switch expression.
